Hello.
This game, Mario & Luigi: Hotel Mania, is a Mario & Luigi fangame that I started working on when Alpha Dream filed for bankruptcy. I constantly restarted the project because of how often I forgot about it, and I would type all of this stuff over and over again.

I own no ownership over Mario characters or the Super Mario IP. All rights to Mario and assests belong to Nintendo.

Thank you so much for taking your time to stop by this file and read it. It makes me feel better about this to include this.
